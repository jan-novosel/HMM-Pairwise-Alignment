# HMM Pairwise Sequence Alignment

**Fakultet elektrotehnike i računarstva**

This project implements a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** for pairwise sequence alignment in C++. The goal of the project was to align two biological sequences using the HMM framework and the **Viterbi algorithm**, which is adapted for this specific application.

This project was developed for the **Bioinformatics 2** course at the **Fakultet elektrotehnike i računarstva, Sveučilište u Zagrebu**.
